### Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è! 

I'm a aspiring programmer who likes working on personal - which i usually keep private - and academic projects.
- I've a curious mind and love to explore various programming areas, which makes me wonder what is my next project!.
- While game development is my ultimate passion, i also like to work with other things, like Web Development.
- I'm currently struggling with a boss called Compilers in college
- To prepare for my goals, I'm currently learning C++, Java and Lua. Maybe Python and C# might be added to this mix soon!

Feel free to explore my repos, I'd love to hear some feedback üòÅ
