### Howdy, fellas! âœŒðŸ˜ƒ

Here am i, a simple programmer who likes working on personal - generally don't push this here ._. - and academic projects.
Like to learn about a bunch of different things, sooo i dunno which is the next project that i'll start.
Actually, i'm suffering with some bosses called Compilers and Distributed Systems in college, cuz looks like a little bit difficult to me.

Check my humble repos if you want!
