### Hi there! 

I'm just a simple programmer who likes working on personal - which i usually keep private - and academic projects.
Like to learn about a bunch of different things, so i'm not sure which is the next project that i'll start.
I'm currently struggling with some bosses called Compilers and Distributed Systems in college - they seem a bit challenging.

Check my humble repos if you want!
